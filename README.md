# Image_Palette_Generator
The add is done to accept only images with format jpeg, png and gif and process the picture to check
the 10 more used color pixels in the photo. It wil output a graph.
The idea is to drag an image and drop it in the dropzone. You need to press the button to process the image and get the result.
You will need to install flask, falsk-dropzone, Pillow, webcolors and scikit-learn for the app to work.
